DynamicJasper

			DynamicJasper (DJ) is an API that hides the complexity of Jasper
			Reports, it helps developers to save time when designing
			simple/medium complexity reports generating the layout of the
			report elements automatically. It creates reports dynamically,
			defining at runtime the columns, column width, groups,
			variables, fonts, charts and sub reports (that can also be dynamic).
		
			DJ keeps full compatibility with Jasper Reports since 
			its a tool that helps create reports programmatically in 
			a easy way (it only interferes with the creation of the report 
			design doing the layout of the elements).
	
			You can use the classic .jrxml files as templates while the
			content and layout of the report elements are handled by the DJ
			API.

Online Demo - DynamicJasper Playground

 The DynamicJasper Playground is an example webapp made in GWT and it is inteded to show all the capabilities and potential that the DynamicJasper
 API provides.
 
 In a near future we will release this playground as a component ready to integrate to your web application.
