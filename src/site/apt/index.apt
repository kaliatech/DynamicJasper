DynamicJasper (version 2.x)

	{{{http://dynamicjasper.sourceforge.net//}Go to latest version site}}

	DynamicJasper (DJ) is an API that hides the complexity of Jasper
	Reports, it helps developers to save time when designing
	simple/medium complexity reports generating the layout of the
	report elements automatically. It creates reports dynamically,
	defining at runtime the columns, column width (auto width), groups,
	variables, fonts, charts, crosstabs, sub reports (that can also be dynamic), page size
	and everything else that you can define at design time.
	
	DJ keeps full compatibility with Jasper Reports since
	it's a tool that helps create reports programmatically in
	a easy way (it only interferes with the creation of the report
	design doing the layout of the elements).
	
	You can use the classic .jrxml files as templates while the
	content and layout of the report elements are handled by the DJ
	API.

Online Demo - DynamicJasper Playground

 The DynamicJasper Playground is an example webapp made in GWT and it is inteded to show all the capabilities and potential that the DynamicJasper
 API provides.
 
 In a near future we will release this playground as a component ready to integrate to your web application.
